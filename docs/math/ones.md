# The Table Of Ones

The table of ones is a well known mathematical aid:

| One | Symbol | One | Equals | Output |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | +      | 1   | =      | 2      |
| 1   | -      | 1   | =      | 0      |
| 1   | /      | 1   | =      | 1      |
| 1   | *      | 1   | =      | 1      |
