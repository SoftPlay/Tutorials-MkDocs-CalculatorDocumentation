### Numbers

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and sometimes 0 are all you'll need.

### Symbols

A hyphen `-` works. Do _**NOT**_ use an Em-Dash or an En-Dash.

## Subtraction

For a crash course in subtraction, observe your bank balance for a week after payday.

## Learning by example

1 - 1 = 0. It's really not that hard.
