# Addition

Addition is the concept of making something more bigger.

## Addition fundementals

### Numbers

Addition is a numbers game, if you aren't familiar with numbers I would strongly recommend taking a GCSE in this subject.
You might not feel very confident with numbers, but you only need to know a few to start with. Heck, if you know the number 1, we can expand those horizons easily _with addition_! How exciting!!

### Symbols

Addition is symbolically illustrated with a slightly-rotated "x" symbol: `+`

## Addition

Addition means "Increase how big one thing is by the bigness of another thing".

## Learning by example

If we have 1, and we make it 1 bigger, that's a 2. Wanna make that 1 bigger again? 3!

Addition works the same way.

1 + 1 = 2.

2 + 1 = 3.

Nice.

# Addition in reverse

There is actually a term for reverse addition, where we want to make a number less big, known as **[subtraction](subtraction.md)**.
