## What is a calculator?
A calculator is an antiquated piece of hardware used for the sole purpose of annoying GCSE students.
Ideally, the calculator should have been made obsolete with the invention of ["the computer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)

Lest we not forget the most famous words ever said about a calculator:
 > I get verklempt if I see a vintage TI-30 or TI-54 calculator. But I don't think I'd want to use one.

\- Douglas Coupland
