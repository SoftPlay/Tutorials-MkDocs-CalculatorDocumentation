# The first button
The first button was invented by a cavewoman, in order to provide the first cave-telephones. It was a physical piece of rock which represented a single number, you would "press" this to invoke that number. You can make anything up here and people won't read it, nobody cares about the history of buttons.

A fun fact: you can make buttons with computer code. Using your favourite IDE, try typing:
```var button = new Button();```

It might not work, but that's known as _the coder's gamble_.
