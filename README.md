* Open an elevated (administrator) Cmd prompt or Powershell session, then:
    * Enter the command `choco install python`
    * Read and accept any relevant prompts with `Y`
    * Enter the command `choco install pip`
    * Read and accept any relevant prompts with `Y`
    * Enter the command `pip install mkdocs`
    * Read and accept any relevant prompts with `Y`
* Once all that is installed, in your command prompt:
    * Navigate to this repository's directory
    * Enter the command `mkdocs serve`
    * Navigate to [http://127.0.01:8000/](http://127.0.01:8000/) in your browser
    * You should be able to see the MkDocs-generated site using the files in this repository!
